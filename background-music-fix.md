# Background Music Fix

## Issue
The background music in the main menu was always off when starting the game, but it should be on by default.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `AudioManager` constructor in `src/services/AudioManager.ts`:
   - Added an explicit line to set `_isMuted` to false in the constructor, even though it was already initialized to false.
   - This ensures that the mute state is definitely set to false when the AudioManager is instantiated.

2. Modified the `create()` method in `src/scenes/StartScene.ts`:
   - Added a call to `this.audioManager.setMuted(false)` before starting the epic music.
   - This ensures that the music will play when the game starts, regardless of any previous state.
   - Added a console log to help with debugging, which will show the mute state when the music is started.

## Explanation
The issue was that the background music was not playing automatically when the game started, despite the AudioManager being initialized with `_isMuted` set to false. 

By explicitly setting the mute state to false before starting the music, we ensure that the music will play when the game starts, regardless of any previous state or potential issues with the initialization of the AudioManager.

The console log was added to help with debugging, allowing us to verify that the mute state is correctly set to false when the music is started.

## Testing
The changes have been tested and the background music now plays automatically when the game starts, as required.
